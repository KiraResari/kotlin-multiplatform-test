* This project is about familiarizing myself with the basics of Kotlin Multiplatform before I try to set up my main winter project for this year
* I am following the print media article "Multipaltformprojekte umsetzen mit KMM" in the "Herbst 3/2022" edition of "We Are Developers!" for this
* It says I need Android Studio for this, so let's see if that's freely available
  * Looks like it is: https://developer.android.com/studio
  * I now managed to successfully install and launch it, so that's already a good start
* The next step tells me to create a new Project from the Template "Kotlin Multiplatform App"
  * Regrettably, that is not available
  * Reading back over the prerequisites, I notice that I still have to install the KMM-Plugin in Android Studio
  * I now found and installed a plugin named "Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile", which I figure might be the right one
  * Looks good, now that I've installed that, I can select the "Kotlin Multiplatform App" project template while creating a new project
  * I note that the initial project setup is taking a long time. I hope that is just a one-time thing
    * Started: 17:57
    * Finished: 18:07
    * Duration: 10 minutes
    * I *really* hope that this is not a regular thing
  * Anyway, with that I think the project setup is complete
